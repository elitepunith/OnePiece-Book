### OnePiece-Book

OnePiece-Book is an interactive web-based character encyclopedia inspired by the One Piece manga and anime series. The project was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external frameworks or libraries.

The application features detailed profiles for 18 legendary pirates, including all ten members of the Straw Hat crew along with notable characters such as Shanks, Kaido, Ace, Whitebeard, Trafalgar Law, Boa Hancock, Dracule Mihawk, and Blackbeard. Each profile includes the character's bounty, backstory, devil fruit or combat abilities, power ratings across five categories, an iconic quote, and their first appearance in the manga.

The interface is designed with a glassmorphism aesthetic, using frosted glass panels and layered transparency against a dark background. Every character has a unique accent color that dynamically updates the entire interface when selected, giving each profile a distinct visual identity. The wanted poster section uses a 3D perspective tilt effect with a light reflection overlay that responds to mouse movement.

Users can navigate between characters using the sidebar, a search bar that filters by name, crew, or role, keyboard arrow keys, or swipe gestures on touch devices. A random character button is also available for quick discovery.

The project is fully responsive with three breakpoints covering desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts. On smaller screens, the sidebar converts to a slide-in drawer with a hamburger toggle. Accessibility has been considered throughout, with ARIA roles, labels, keyboard support, and reduced motion preferences respected for users who have that setting enabled.

This project was built as a personal challenge to create something visually polished and functionally rich without depending on any tooling beyond the core web technologies.
